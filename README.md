# Dual-Path Fixed-Point Adaptive Engine (DPFAE)
### A Geometry-Aware, Ergodic, and Hardware-Native Architecture for Stable Online Learning

DPFAE is a fixed-point adaptive learning engine designed for real-time edge intelligence and neuromorphic hardware.

Unlike conventional optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSProp) that rely on floating-point arithmetic and heuristic moment scaling, DPFAE operates entirely in integer (Q-format) arithmetic while preserving provable stability, variance suppression, and geometric consistency.

The engine implements a dual-path stochastic approximation process with bounded manifold dynamics, making it highly suitable for power-constrained hardware.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Dual-Path Update Law**  
  Separates fast reactive updates from slow adaptive gain control.

- **Hardware-Native Fixed-Point Arithmetic**  
  Fully integer-based (Q16.16), eliminating floating-point units.

- **Provable Stability & Boundedness**  
  State evolution remains in compact invariant sets.

- **Variance Suppression**  
  Adaptive gain reduces steady-state RMSE versus constant-gain updates.

- **Geometric Consistency**  
  Unit-norm projection enforces manifold-constrained learning (S³ for quaternion states).

- **Linear-Time Complexity**  
  O(n) element-wise updates — no matrix inversion.

## 🧠 Core Update Dynamics

Let:

- θₜ = state/parameter vector  
- gₜ = stochastic gradient or error  
- αₜ = adaptive gain  
- η = base step size  

### Reactive Path (fast correction)

θₜ₊₁ = Π( θₜ − η αₜ gₜ )

where Π enforces unit-norm projection (manifold constraint).

### Adaptive Gain Path

αₜ₊₁ = clip( γ αₜ + f(|gₜ|) )

This decouples convergence speed from noise sensitivity.

## 📐 Why Dual-Path Works

| Component | Function |
|----------|---------|
| Reactive updates | rapid error correction |
| Gain adaptation | noise suppression |
| Projection | bounded geometry |
| Gain decay | convergence + stability |

Result: fast convergence without stochastic oscillation.

## 📈 Theoretical Foundations

DPFAE directly instantiates well-studied stochastic dynamical systems:

### 1. Stochastic Approximation (Robbins–Monro)

Adaptive step-size recursion ensures convergence under bounded noise.

### 2. Stability & Ergodicity (Kushner & Yin; Meyn & Tweedie)

- bounded invariant sets via projection  
- ergodic convergence of time averages  

### 3. Variance Reduction (Polyak–Juditsky)

Adaptive gain collapses steady-state variance.

### 4. Information Geometry (Čencov; Amari)

Manifold-constrained updates approximate natural gradient flow without matrix inversion.

### 5. Free-Energy / Rational Inattention Dynamics

Gain adaptation balances error correction against switching cost (energy-efficient learning).
