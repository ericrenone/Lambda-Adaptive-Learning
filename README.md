# Dual-Path Lambda Learning  
### Functional Adaptive Convergence via Drift Minimization and Gain Control

This repository implements a **minimal functional learning system** that compares two fundamentally different optimization dynamics:

• Standard gradient drift minimization  
• Adaptive gain-controlled learning with internal sensitivity decay  

The system is built entirely from **immutable lambda-style state transitions**, turning learning into a clean dynamical process rather than imperative parameter mutation.

Convergence is evaluated using **information-theoretic drift (KL divergence)** alongside prediction error.

## The simulation demonstrates that adaptive gain learning preserves convergence speed while significantly reducing stochastic variance, producing smooth, repeatable, and noise-robust trajectories.

## 🔍 Core Concept

Learning is modeled as a deterministic state machine:

Each update step:

1. Observes noisy data sampled from a true underlying distribution  
2. Computes an error signal relative to the current internal belief  
3. Applies pure functional transitions to produce the next state  

Two learning pathways operate in parallel:

### Path A — Drift Minimization

A classic gradient descent dynamic that directly adjusts the internal representation toward observed data.

### Path B — Adaptive Gain Control

A coupled system where:

• The representation is updated  
• A sensitivity (gain) parameter scales learning intensity  
• The gain decays over time, stabilizing convergence  

This creates a self-regulating learning process.

## 🧠 Functional Architecture

All learning behavior is expressed as stateless transformations:

• No in-place parameter mutation  
• No optimizer objects  
• No hidden side effects  

State evolution is entirely driven by composable transition functions.

This mirrors functional dynamical systems used in theoretical ML and neuromorphic models.

## 📊 What Is Measured

At every step the system tracks:

• Information drift between learned and true distributions  
• Prediction error on sampled data  
• Internal gain dynamics  

This directly measures **how accurately the model infers reality**, not just loss reduction.

## 🔬 Key Experimental Observations

Across runs, adaptive gain control consistently:

✅ Converges faster  
✅ Produces smoother learning curves  
✅ Resists noise-induced oscillations  
✅ Stabilizes long-term inference  

While drift-only learning overshoots and fluctuates under noise.
